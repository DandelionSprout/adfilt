Converted from https://github.com/AdguardTeam/HostlistsRegistry/tree/main/services.

As I gradually began thinking after some years that AdGuard had no intentions of converting their 3-digit number of service blocking options that they use for AdGuard Home and AdGuard Private DNS, to AdGuard/uBlock Origin, I thought <i>"Sure, I can try to see if mass-conversions are possible"</i>. It is.

As of when the project started on 9 March 2024, I quickly realised that many of Team AdGuard's service blocks could be abused by strict or cruel parents, so I do not convert almost any gaming or streaming sites' services.
