! Title: ðŸ’¬ Twitch: Pure Viewing Experience
! Version: 04October2019v3-Beta
! Expires: 4 days
! Description: This list aims to remove distracting elements, and to maximise the elements inside the chat to make it easier to read.
! Note that this list does not remove in-player ads at all. There are several other lists out there that you'll need to keep frequently updated in order to accomplish that.
! In order to hide buttons and links to Amazon's account and payment services, check out "Anti-Amazon List for Twitch" (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/AntiAmazonListForTwitch.txt).

! Removes the "Recommended channels" section when you're not logged on
twitch.tv##.tw-full-width > .tw-mg-b-2

! Attempts to remove suggestions from the "Following" page
twitch.tv#?#div:-abp-has(:scope > .tw-mg-b-1 > h4[data-a-target="live-channels-header"]) + div

! Aims to remove the spacing between Twitch emotes, for the sake of multi-part emotes
twitch.tv##.message > span:-abp-contains( ):not(:-abp-contains(/[a-z"?!]/i))
clips.twitch.tv##span.text-fragment:not(:-abp-contains(/[a-z"?!]/i))

! Desperately tries to remove the "Popular videos [from everywhere]" row and most likely failing at it.
clips.twitch.tv#?#div:nth-of-type(3):-abp-has(:scope > .tw-pd-y-2)
