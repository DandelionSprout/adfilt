! Title: 🐑 Dandelion Sprout's List for Young People
! Version: 09April2023v1-PreAlpha-Compilation
! Description: This list is designed for kids 13 and younger, to attempt to remove stuff that are actually dangerous to kids' sanity, as opposed to other parental filterlists out there that just do blanket bans on all porn and which have huge coverage gaps at that.
! What this broad compilation blocks in uBO and AdGuard: Abuse imagery, futanari, macro imagery, deviantART copypaste spam, Elsagate videos, malware links, Discord account hackers, newssites/SoMe strongly associated with racism.
! At age 14, it can be assumed that any kid will have learned how to turn off extensions and lists, at which point they've most likely outgrown the list.
! As of 9th of April 2023, it was hard to tell if any more component lists would become part of the compilation, hence the "PreAlpha" status.
