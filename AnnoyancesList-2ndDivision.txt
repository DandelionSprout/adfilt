! Title: 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦 Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List 2nd Division Bachelors
! Version: 13December2022v1-Alpha-Compilation
! Expires: 3 days
! Description: This compilation include lists that are maintained as properly and proudly as those in the main Annoyances List, but which have unresolved matters about overblocking, unusual topics, or potential regional legal issues (primarily in the Middle East), that would've caused the AdGuard Filters Registry team to raise eyebrows until resolvements have been agreed on.
