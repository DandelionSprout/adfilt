! Description: AdGuard Home is one of the tools for the future. However, its current internal structure discards virtually every $-using block rule, which makes various major lists virtually useless in AdGuard Home, despite how many of the entries would be ≥90% as functional without them. So until the AdGuard Home team implements a better way to deal with $ values, here's my intermissional list to work around it.
! Note: If a list update is needed quickly, check out the instructions at https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/AdGuard%20Home%20Compilation%20List/README.md
