! Description: AdGuard Home is one of the tools for the future, or at least it is for those who know how to set up and use a Raspberry Pi. However, its current internal structure discards virtually every $-using block rule (e.g. EasyList), which makes EasyList and similar lists virtually useless in AdGuard Home, despite how many of the entries would be ≥90% as functional without them. So until the AdGuard Home team implements a better way to deal with $ values, here's my intermissional list to work around it.
! Motivation: Originally conceived as a temporary workaround to use major adblocker lists in AdGuard Base, it gradually grew in scope to become a de facto competitor to «AdGuard DNS Filter» with broader wildcard use and no tracker-blocking.
! Note: The list is not designed with uBlock Origin in mind, for which I recommend using the various individual source lists instead.
