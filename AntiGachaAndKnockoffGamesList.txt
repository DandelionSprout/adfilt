! Title: 🛅 Anti-'Gacha and Knockoff Games' List
! Version: 22January2024v1-Alpha-Compilation
! Expires: 6 days
! Description: So, perhaps you're someone who take your gaming library and hobby pretty seriously, and who feel revolted by pay-to-win, blatant knockoffs, and very violent apps disguised as kids apps? In that case, this list is everything you could dream of.
! Note: This list goes very far in blocking its intended target topics, which at the time of writing leads to e.g. Fortnite Twitch streams and Azur Lane Pixiv fanart being blocked as well.
