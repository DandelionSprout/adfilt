! Title: 🗨 Anti-'Google Hangouts' List
! Version: 28October2023v1-Beta
! Expires: 20 days
! Description: Are you a non-user of Hangouts, and are tired of seeing the uncloseable Hangouts section on Gmail, and various Hangouts buttons and pages? Then this is the list for you.
! I (The list maintainer) have been made aware of the phase-out of Hangouts Classic in the 2nd half of 2020. So far it remains to be seen whether this list will retain a reason to exist afterwards or not.
