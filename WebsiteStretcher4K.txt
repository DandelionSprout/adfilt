! Description: Do you have a huge high-resolution monitor, and are feeling bothered by how websites still think that everyone are using 768-1080px monitors? Well, here's how to stretch them out like a piece of gum!
! This is a special edition for both widening and heightening that is designed for people with really large monitors, usually 4K and 5K monitors, as well as insanely overpriced 1440p IPS monitors in portrait mode. Users of 1080p monitors should check out the widener-only version at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Website%20Stretcher.txt
