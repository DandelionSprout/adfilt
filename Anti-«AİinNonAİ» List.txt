! Title: 🍁 Anti-"Aİ results in tech situations where Aİ was not asked for" List
! Version: 12December2025v1-Alpha
! Expires: 2 days
! Homepage: https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/tree/master
! Description: 1) I'm way too old for the Aİ bubble, and I'm not even 30 yet. 2) Google's pushing of Aİ in regular search results in particular have a very bad reputation for often being wrong about things. This list will however not block Aİ prompt sites.
! Note: No, I am not going to remove Aİ results on artsites. The sites generally already have anti-Aİ search filters, and on Deviantart in particular are Aİ things better than 90% of their non-Aİ things.
! Note 2: https://new•reddit•com/r/GoogleAIGoneWild/top/?t=month should be sufficient proof to give this sub-list hastily expedited implementation to Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List.
