! Title: 🌞 Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Racism List
! Version: 31May2020v1-Beta-Compilation
! Expires: 5 days
! Description: I have been of the ideas that humans should respect each other, help each other and base their activities on actual facts. Sadly, several hundred million internetizens out there did not catch that memo. This list aims to remove such disruptive, hateful and bewilderingly aggressive factors from certain crucial parts of the internet.
! Note: There may be some collateral damage on Twitter in particular, wherein even the very few internetizens out there who speak positively of left-wing politicians, would see their messages be removed from your view. Sadly, because 80% of those who discuss them have homicidal ambitions against them, there's no good way for me to get around it.
! Note 2: There's also many Twitch users who are convinced that Pepe the Frog is not racist, at least not when used for Twitch emotion reactions. I do however not believe them on their claims.
