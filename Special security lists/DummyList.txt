! Title: 🔳 Dummy List to Avoid 'No lists turned on' Warnings
! Version: 10September2020v1-Deprecated
! Expires: 30 days
! Description: This is primarily designed for users of AdGuard for Android, who wish to use its DNS server function with no local DNS filter lists, while not having to see the "No filters enabled. Enable some." notice each and every time they enter the DNS settings. It contains 1 entry, for a dummy domain which will by all feasible earmark never become registered at any point in human history.
! Homepage: https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#-english
! AdGuard for Android 4.x seems to have removed the notice, making this list no longer needed.
