! Title: ðŸ”³ HTTPS-only Mode for All Browsers
! Version: 10September2025v1-Beta
! Expires: 30 days
! Description: I discovered in November 2023 that there was a non-zero market for this kind of list, so here it is.
! I would NOT recommend this list for people who don't explicity need it, because online links where the site owners simply skipped the "https://" part entirely and started the link at "nrk.no/(â€¦)" or similar, will result in at the very least the page warning.
