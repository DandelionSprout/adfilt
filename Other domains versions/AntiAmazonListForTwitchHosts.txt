# Title: 📭 Anti-Amazon List for Twitch («Hosts» version)
# Version: 04August2019v1-Beta
# Expires: 2 days
# Motivation: As someone who lives in Norway, which is not an Amazon core country, I became increasingly annoyed at how they hid away shipping fees from me, and even more annoyed when they barred third-party sellers from shipping abroad. Thus I deleted my Amazon account in protest, and to this day I refuse to make a new one.
