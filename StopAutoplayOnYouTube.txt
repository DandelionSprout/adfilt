! Title: 🎬 Stop Autoplay On YouTube
! Expires: 14 days
! Version: 06September2019v3
! Description: Are you tired of having to turn off autoplay on YouTube, Vimeo, and other video sites every time you e.g. go to incognito mode? Do you work in classrooms/courserooms and don't want to accidentally show unfitting videos to your students/coursetakers? Are you worried of having to use specific extensions just for that purpose? Then this list is for you.

! Note: Once the outro screen is triggered and blocked, the page has to be reloaded to play the same video again. It also remains stuck on an ominously red-tinted frame when it happens.
