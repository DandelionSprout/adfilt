! Expires: 7 days
! Version: 11September2019v1
! Description: Are you tired of having to turn off autoplay on YouTube, Vimeo, and other video sites every time you e.g. go to incognito mode? Do you work in classrooms/courserooms and don't want to accidentally show unfitting videos to your students/coursetakers? Are you worried of having to use specific extensions just for that purpose? Then this list is for you.
