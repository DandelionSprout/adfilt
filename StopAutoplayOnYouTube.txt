! Title: 🎬 Stop Autoplay On Video Sites
! Expires: 7 days
! Version: 24March2024v1
! Description: Are you tired of having to turn off autoplay on YouTube, Vimeo, and other video sites every time you e.g. go to incognito mode? Do you work in classrooms/courserooms and don't want to accidentally show unfitting videos to your students/coursetakers? Are you worried of having to use specific extensions just for that purpose? Then this list is for you.
! Special thanks to https://github.com/llacb47 for waterproofing large parts of this list.
! Homepage: https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#-english

! I offer a €15 bounty to anyone who can figure out how to automatically turn off autoplay on Dailymotion through one or more uBlock Origin entries, payable by PayPal.

! Note: Once the outro screen is triggered and blocked, the page has to be reloaded to play the same video again. It also remains stuck on an ominously red-tinted frame when it happens.
