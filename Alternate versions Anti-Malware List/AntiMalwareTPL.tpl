# Title: ðŸ’Š Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List (Internet Explorer TPL)
# Version: 24September2019v2-Beta
: expires = 5
# Description: Most anti-malware lists are pretty big and can cover a 5- or 6-digit amount of specific domains. But my list hereby claims to remove more than 25% of all known malware sites with just a 2-digit amount of entries. This is mostly done by blocking top-level domains that have become devastatingly abused by spammers, usually because they allowed for free and uncontrolled domain registrations. There's also additional categories that cover unusual malware and phishing domains that very few other lists seem to cover.
# For more information, details, helpful tools, and other lists that I've made, visit https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english

# â€”â€”â€” Country domains â€”â€”â€”
# You can expect these domains to have an overwhelming majority of malware domains that have nothing to do with the countries in question. Nevertheless, if you are in a situation where you have to do active business in any of the countries in question, then this list may not be ideal for you.

# â€”â€”â€” Attempted removal of Google search result entries that lead to the above top-level domains (Advanced adblockers only) â€”â€”â€”

# â€”â€”â€” You know those ultra-fraudulent websites who clutter up Google searches, who have some seemingly random ".php?" values in their URLs? These entries should remove some of them. â€”â€”â€”

# Note for Firefox on Android users: I strongly recommend the use of https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/google-search-fixer/ for use on Firefox for Android, thus the entries are written for the Chrome version of Google Mobile.
