# Title: 💊 Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List (Domains list version)
# Version: 24February2021v2-Beta
# Expires: 5 days
# Description: Most anti-malware lists are pretty big and can cover a 5- or 6-digit amount of specific domains. But my list hereby claims to remove more than 25% of all known malware sites with just a 2-digit amount of entries. This is mostly done by blocking top-level domains that have become devastatingly abused by spammers, usually because they allowed for free and uncontrolled domain registrations. There's also additional categories that cover unusual malware and phishing domains that very few other lists seem to cover.

# ——— Bad top-level domains ———
# You can expect these domains to have an overwhelming majority of malware domains that have nothing to do with the countries in question. Nevertheless, if you are in a situation where you have to do active business in any of the countries in question, then this list may not be ideal for you.
# Tokelau

# Gabon

# Mali

# Equatorial Guinea

# Central African Republic

# Palau

# International topical domains that have consistently horrendous scores on watchlists of bad TLDs, and whose use for legit purposes is practically non-existent.







# ——— Attempted removal of Google search result entries that lead to the above top-level domains (Advanced adblockers only) ———

# ——— You know those ultra-fraudulent auto-generated things that clutter up Google searches? These entries should remove some of them. ———

# ——— For Google Mobile ———

# ——— Old dead tech-related domains ———
# Domains that used to host lists for adblockers or "hosts" tools, but which are now either used by malware pushers, or could potentially be snapped up by them.
