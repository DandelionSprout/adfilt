[Adblock Plus 3.4]
! Title: 🎮 Game Console Adblock List
! Version: 02January2021v1-Alpha
! Expires: 4 days
! Description: Much like there's now lists for AdGuard Home and Pi-hole to block ads on smart-TVs, here's an attempt from me at doing the same for videogame consoles with AdGuard Home. Enjoy.
! Important note: To block ads in the consoles' dedicated internet browsers with AdGuard Home, and not in the system menus, check out https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/AdGuard%20Home%20Compilation%20List/AdGuardHomeCompilationList.txt instead.
! For more information, details, helpful tools, and other lists that I've made, visit https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english

! Blocks the "Theme Shop", with the intention of preventing the annoying pink dot in the upper left of the Home Menu from reappearing all the time.
! WARNING: The "Theme Shop" should be visited once to remove the pink dot, and only then should this list be subscribed to.

! ——— Wii U ———
! Believed to reduce the initial loading time of Wii Sports Club by several seconds
! Since no third-party Miiverse clients with console support are believed to be able to exist by now (January 2020), this entry is pretty much here to stay.

! ——— Nintendo Switch ———
! There is a system setting for getting rid of the Nintendo eShop advertisements on the lockscreen, which is hidden in System Settings → System → News Channel Settings → Nintendo News → Unfollow.
! The following entries gives access on demand to the web browser, as per SwitchBru's DNS server trick (https://www.switchbru.com/dns/), while also making it possible to use AdGuard Home for adblocking at the same time. However, since SwitchBru uses a trick to make the Switch think it's partway into logging on to a hotel network, the entries would reject access to all other Switch web activities while the entries are live:
!!! 45.55.142.122 ctest.cdn.nintendo.net
!!! 127.0.0.1 receive-lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net
!!! 127.0.0.1 aauth-lp1.ndas.srv.nintendo.net

! ——— Nintendo DS / Wii ———
! For a largely official list to connect to Wiimmfi (for DS games only) and RiiConnect24, check out https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RiiConnect24/DNS-Server/master/dns_zones-hosts.txt

! ——— PlayStation 5 ———
! I offer a €10 bounty to anyone who know how to either turn off the Explore menu tab, or prevent the Explore tab from loading any content, payable by PayPal.

! ——— PlayStation 4 ———
! There is a system setting for getting rid of homescreen "Buy Now"-type ads, which is hidden in Settings → System → Automatic Downloads → Featured Content → Off.

! ——— PlayStation 2 ———
! I am not personally aware of any Free McBoot homebrew apps that can connect to external domains, let alone unintentionally.
! There were multiple third-party online game servers for the PS2, of which Bobz Entertainment and OpenSpy are the only ones with some functionality still working.
! Any IP redirection entries for those two servers would've excluded one another; plus it appears that griefing was/is a very huge concern among the PS2 modding community, which I can vaguely presume is why they haven't openly revealed their DNS-server-side IP redirections.

! ——— Xbox Series ———
! I offer a €10 bounty to anyone who know how to remove the sponsored ads in the main menu, payable by PayPal.

! ——— Dreamcast ———
! Although I have become aware of the existence of Dreamcast Live, I can't find the IP address redirections used by their DNS server.

! ——— Steam Machines / SteamOS / Steam ———
! To get rid of popup windows that promote new games in desktop mode, go to View → Settings → Interface → "Notify me about additions or changes to my games, new releases, and upcoming releases."

! ——— Epic Games Store ———
! To remove system notifications that promote new games and sales, go to Settings → Desktop notifications, and turn off "Show News and Special Offer Notifications" and optionally "Show Free Game Notifications"

! ——— Other consoles ———
! Entry suggestions on GitHub would be much appreciated. Especially for portable PlayStation consoles and Sega Saturn, as I don't own any of them.
