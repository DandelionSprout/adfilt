[Adblock Plus 3.6]
! Title: ðŸŽ® Game Console Adblock List
! Version: 27April2024v1-Alpha
! Expires: 10 days
! Description: Much like there's now lists for AdGuard Home and Pi-hole to block ads on smart-TVs, here's an attempt from me at doing the same for videogame consoles with AdGuard Home. Enjoy.
! Important note: To block ads in the consoles' dedicated internet browsers with AdGuard Home, and not in the system menus, check out https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/AdGuard%20Home%20Compilation%20List/AdGuardHomeCompilationList.txt instead.

! â€”â€”â€” Nintendo Switch â€”â€”â€”
! There is a system setting for getting rid of the Nintendo eShop advertisements on the lockscreen, which is hidden in System Settings â†’ System â†’ News Channel Settings â†’ Nintendo News â†’ Unfollow.
! The following entries gives access on demand to the web browser, as per SwitchBru's DNS server trick (https://www.switchbru.com/dns/), while also making it possible to use AdGuard Home for adblocking at the same time. However, since SwitchBru uses a trick to make the Switch think it's partway into logging on to a hotel network, the entries would reject access to all other Switch web activities while the entries are live:
!!! 45.55.142.122 ctest.cdn.nintendo.net
!!! 127.0.0.1 receive-lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net
!!! 127.0.0.1 aauth-lp1.ndas.srv.nintendo.net

! â€”â€”â€” Nintendo DS / Wii â€”â€”â€”
! For a largely official list to connect to Wiimmfi (for DS games only) and RiiConnect24, check out https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RiiConnect24/DNS-Server/master/dns_zones-hosts.txt

! â€”â€”â€” PlayStation 5 â€”â€”â€”
! I offer a â‚¬10 bounty to anyone who know how to either turn off the Explore menu tab, or prevent the Explore tab from loading any content, payable by PayPal.

! â€”â€”â€” PlayStation 4 â€”â€”â€”
! There is a system setting for getting rid of homescreen "Buy Now"-type ads, which is hidden in Settings â†’ System â†’ Automatic Downloads â†’ Featured Content â†’ Off.

! â€”â€”â€” PlayStation 2 â€”â€”â€”
! I am not personally aware of any Free McBoot homebrew apps that can connect to external domains, let alone unintentionally.
! There are multiple third-party online game servers for the PS2, most of them with flimsy websites and uptime. Popular ones include PS2 Online and Bobz Entertainment. See https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bbxOGm4dPxZ4Vbzyu3XxBnZmuPx3Ue-cPqBeTxtnvkQ for details.
! Any IP redirection entries for servers would've excluded one another; plus it appears that griefing was/is a very huge concern among the PS2 modding community, which I can vaguely presume is why they haven't openly revealed their DNS-server-side IP redirections.

! â€”â€”â€” Xbox Series X/S â€”â€”â€”
! I received a tip by E-mail of somehow who said he had accomplished this, mostly as a result of using other lists, most prominently AdGuard DNS Filter and HaGeZi's Pro++ Blocklist.

! â€”â€”â€” Dreamcast â€”â€”â€”
! Although I have become aware of the existence of Dreamcast Live, I can't find the IP address redirections used by their DNS server.

! â€”â€”â€” Steam Machines / SteamOS / Steam â€”â€”â€”
! To get rid of popup windows that promote new games in desktop mode, go to View â†’ Settings â†’ Interface â†’ "Notify me about additions or changes to my games, new releases, and upcoming releases."

! â€”â€”â€” Epic Games Store â€”â€”â€”
! To remove system notifications that promote new games and sales, go to Settings â†’ Desktop notifications, and turn off "Show News and Special Offer Notifications" and optionally "Show Free Game Notifications"

! â€”â€”â€” Other consoles â€”â€”â€”
! Entry suggestions on GitHub would be much appreciated.
! Especially desired, since I don't own them: Sega Saturn, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, Xbox (2001 model), GameCube (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube_online_functionality#Supported_games), Game Boy Color/Advance (https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mobile_System_GB#Access), PlayStation 1 (i-Mode adapter), Nintendo 64 (Randnet, Morita Shogi 64 modem), Nokia N-Gage
