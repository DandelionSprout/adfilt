[Adblock Plus 3.12]
! Title: 🎮 Game Console Adblock List
! Version: 21March2024v1-Alpha
! Expires: 10 days
! Description: Much like there's now lists for AdGuard Home and Pi-hole to block ads on smart-TVs, here's an attempt from me at doing the same for videogame consoles with AdGuard Home. Enjoy.
! Important note: To block ads in the consoles' dedicated internet browsers with AdGuard Home, and not in the system menus, check out https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/AdGuard%20Home%20Compilation%20List/AdGuardHomeCompilationList.txt instead.
! Note 2: Although this list only had 11 relevent entries as of 27 April 2024, I decided against merging it into any other lists, as it would cause complications at best for people who indeed do use this list specifically for their game consoles.

! ——— PlayStation 3 ———
! Ads; but in the time between 2019 and 2024, I can no longer remember what the ads were
||nsx-e.np.dl.playstation.net^
! What's New. This one is certainly going to stay for years to come, after I googled «ps3 "what's new"» again.
||mercury.dl.playstation.net^
! PlayStation Store Preview, incl. 'My Channels' logos
||nsx.np.dl.playstation.net^
! Ticker ads in the XMB clockbar, as a row immediately below the clock date and the friend counter
||adproxy.ndmdhs.com^

! ——— Wii U ———
! Currently no entries.

! ——— Xbox One ———
! Removes sponsored info slots in the system menu

! Note that this also blocks Perks from Xbox Game Pass if you are subscribed to that (https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/pull/162).

! ——— Xbox 360 ———
! Removes paid advertising on the Xbox Live Dashboard

! ——— Nintendo Switch ———
! Play reports/Telemetry servers (https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/pull/1115)
||receive-lp1.dg.srv.nintendo.net 
||realtime-receive-lp1.dg.srv.nintendo.net
! Error reports
||receive-lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net
! Unknown; could be for profiles (https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/pull/1115)
||sprofile-lp1.cdn.nintendo.net
! There is a system setting for getting rid of the Nintendo eShop advertisements on the lockscreen, which is hidden in System Settings → System → News Channel Settings → Nintendo News → Unfollow.
! The following entries gives access on demand to the web browser, as per SwitchBru's DNS server trick (https://www.switchbru.com/dns/), while also making it possible to use AdGuard Home for adblocking at the same time. However, since SwitchBru uses a trick to make the Switch think it's partway into logging on to a hotel network, the entries would reject access to all other Switch web activities while the entries are live:
!!! 45.55.142.122 ctest.cdn.nintendo.net
!!! 127.0.0.1 receive-lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net
!!! 127.0.0.1 aauth-lp1.ndas.srv.nintendo.net

! ——— Nintendo DS / Wii ———
! For a largely official list to connect to Wiimmfi (for DS games only) and RiiConnect24, check out https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RiiConnect24/DNS-Server/master/dns_zones-hosts.txt

! ——— PlayStation 5 ———
||telemetry-console.api.playstation.com^
||telemetry-cii.api.playstation.com^
! Unknown how to do: Prevent the "Explore" tab from showing all sorts of random promotions.

! ——— PlayStation 4 ———
! There is a system setting for getting rid of homescreen "Buy Now"-type ads, which is hidden in Settings → System → Automatic Downloads → Featured Content → Off.

! ——— PlayStation 2 ———
! I am not personally aware of any Free McBoot homebrew apps that can connect to external domains, let alone unintentionally.
! There are multiple third-party online game servers for the PS2, most of them with flimsy websites and uptime. Popular ones include PS2 Online and Bobz Entertainment. See https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bbxOGm4dPxZ4Vbzyu3XxBnZmuPx3Ue-cPqBeTxtnvkQ for details.
! Any IP redirection entries for servers would've excluded one another; plus it appears that griefing was/is a very huge concern among the PS2 modding community, which I can vaguely presume is why they haven't openly revealed their DNS-server-side IP redirections.

! ——— Xbox Series X/S ———
! I received a tip by E-mail of somehow who said he had accomplished this, mostly as a result of using other lists, most prominently AdGuard DNS Filter and HaGeZi's Pro++ Blocklist.

! Just in case:

! ——— Dreamcast ———
! Although I have become aware of the existence of Dreamcast Live, I can't find the IP address redirections used by their DNS server.

! ——— Steam Machines / SteamOS / Steam ———
! To get rid of popup windows that promote new games in desktop mode, go to View → Settings → Interface → "Notify me about additions or changes to my games, new releases, and upcoming releases."

! ——— Epic Games Store ———
! To remove system notifications that promote new games and sales, go to Settings → Desktop notifications, and turn off "Show News and Special Offer Notifications" and optionally "Show Free Game Notifications"

! ——— Other consoles ———
