! Title: ðŸ–± Anti-'PC component price hiders' List
! Version: 02October2019v1-Beta
! Expires: 8 days
! Description: Have you ever been searching for rare PC parts, but a lot the sites you visit refuse to tell you the murderous prices they charge unless you sign up as a member with them? Now you won't feel infuriated by it anymore! While this list is designed for Â«Google Hit Hider by DomainÂ» to remove search results, it can also be used with other domains-list tools if you want more thorough blocking of them.
! Entries from any and all countries that are submitted to me on GitHub, will be accepted. It's just that I personally very rarely look for rare PC parts outside of Norwegian and Swedish sites.
! For more information, details, helpful tools, and other lists that I've made, visit https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english
