Issue reports will be processed, but issues that are exclusive to these adblockers will rarely be accomodated for.

| Affected tool | Reason for its support being limited | Fully supported substitute |
| - | - | - |
| uBlock Origin's Thunderbird branch | Doesn't seem to work properly in E-mail view mode. | AdGuard for Windows |
| AdGuard for iOS | I do not have such units to test it with. | |
| Pi-hole | Linux is far too complicated to set up and keep up to date. | AdGuard Home |
| 1blocker for iOS | I do not have an iOS unit to test it with. | Adblock Browser for iOS | |
| Pale Moon / Basilisk with uBlock Origin | Very hostile behaviour by a high-ranking Pale Moon dev. | Waterfox Classic with uBlock Origin |
| AdGuard Content Blocker for Samsung/Yandex | I'd need to set up those browsers on request. It also has pretty limited syntax support. | Firefox for Android with uBlock Origin |

# No support

If you use an adblocker from this section, you will be asked to change to another updated adblocker before an issue report would be processed.

### Problematic web browsers

| uBlock Origin's Microsoft Edge legacy branch | Seemed to have severe problems with list syncing in mid-2018. | AdGuard for Windows (Paid version) |
| Borealis with uBlock Origin | Very hostile behaviour by Borealis' main developer. | Waterfox Classic with uBlock Origin |
| AdGuard for Safari ≥13 | No support is offered to Safari ≥13 in protest against Manifest V3-like extension systems. | Google Chrome with uBlock Origin |
