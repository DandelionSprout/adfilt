! Description: 1) I'm way too old for the Aİ bubble, and I'm not even 30 yet. 2) Google's pushing of Aİ in regular search results in particular have a very bad reputation for often being wrong about things. This list will however not block Aİ prompt sites.
! Note: No, I am not going to remove Aİ results on artsites. The sites generally already have anti-Aİ search filters, and on Deviantart in particular are Aİ things better than 90% of their non-Aİ things.
