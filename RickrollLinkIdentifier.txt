! Title: 🎙 Rickroll Link Identifier
! Version: 10October2019v1-Alpha
! Expires: 10 days
! Description: So you're browsing Reddit or Twitch, and you're seeing an interesting info link? Well… about that link… this list will turn links to the biggest YouTube uploads of Rick Astley's «Never Gonna Give You Up» into a bright red colour, thus helping you steer clear of being rickrolled.
! Never in my entire life have I seen anyone try to link to e.g. the Spotify uploads of «Never Gonna Give You Up» for rickrolling, so I'll skip adding entries for streaming service links for now.
! I have been made aware of «Whenever You Need Somebody» having the same intro, but at the current point in time that song is considered to be out of scope for this list.
